# week1-challenge
This is the challenge for my week 1 assignment. In this challenge, I refactored existing HTML, CSS and Git.


## Description

The refactoring of this challenge should adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work. Upon completing this challenge it will prepare me for workflows I will experience as a professional full-stack web developer. 

## User Story

```
As the owner of a Marketing Agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT my site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN the webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
